# Project 2 - *WORDLE*

Submitted by: **Henry Alumona**

**Wordle** is an app that is a word puzzle game where players attempt to guess a hidden five-letter word within a limited number of tries, usually six. After each guess, the game provides feedback on the accuracy of the guessed word's letters and positions. Players must strategically deduce the target word by using the feedback and logic to solve the puzzle. It's a fun and challenging game that tests word and deduction skills.
